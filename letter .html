  <h2>Hi Jaya ‚ú®</h2>
  <p>
I'm really sorry if this message upsets or angers you. That‚Äôs not my intention at all, and I hope you can understand where I‚Äôm coming from.

The truth is, I‚Äôve been struggling with my emotions. Day by day, it's getting harder to hold things in because carrying all of this inside is tearing me apart.

Every day, I find it harder to control my emotions. I just want to be honest with you ‚Äî because keeping quiet doesn't feel right anymore.

I still love you deeply.

I know I made a big mistake in the past, and that‚Äôs what caused us to fall apart. I‚Äôve had to live with that, and it‚Äôs not easy. After three years of silence, seeing you again last year brought back a kind of happiness I hadn‚Äôt felt in a long time. And now, a year later, those same feelings are even stronger ‚Äî like the old, happy days we once shared.

I‚Äôm not trying to justify anything or tell long stories to defend my past. I take responsibility for what I did, and I‚Äôm not asking for anything based on sympathy.

What scares me the most is the thought of losing you forever ‚Äî even as a friend. That‚Äôs a pain I don‚Äôt think I can bear. And yes, I know this might sound bold, but I have to say it:
I don‚Äôt want to lose you to someone else.
I want you in my life ‚Äî not just as a friend, but as my partner. Someone I can grow with, explore life with, and build a future with.

Please don‚Äôt be angry. I‚Äôm saying all of this because I truly care. I respect you deeply, and whatever your answer is, I‚Äôll accept it. I just needed to be honest.

And if you don‚Äôt feel the same, I understand. I truly do. All I ask is‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt shut me out completely. That‚Äôs a kind of loss I don‚Äôt think I could ever fully recover from.

I know this might feel sudden. Maybe even crazy. But I‚Äôm not saying it recklessly. I‚Äôve had time to think. Time to grow. Time to realize what really matters.

So I‚Äôll say this plainly and from the bottom of my heart:
  </p>
